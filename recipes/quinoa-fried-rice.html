<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients-list">
        <li>3 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>2 eggs, whisked</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, peeled, diced</li>
        <li>1 small white onion, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        <li>4 cups cooked and chilled quinoa</li>
        <li>3 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>3-4 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp toasted sesame oil</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h1>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Heat 1/2 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until melted. Add egg, and cook until scrambled, stirring occasionally. Remove egg, and transfer to a separate plate.</li>
        <li>Add an additional 1 tablespoon butter to the pan and heat until melted. Add carrots, onion, peas and garlic, and season with a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Saute for about 5 minutes or until the onion and carrots are soft. Increase heat to high, add in the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter, and stir until melted. Immediately add the cooked quinoa, green onions, soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using), and stir until combined. Continue stirring for an additional 3 minutes to fry the quinoa. Then add in the eggs and stir to combine. Add the sesame oil, stir to combine, and remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
